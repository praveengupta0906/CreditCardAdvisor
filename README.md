# Credit Card Advisor AI

## Project Overview

The Credit Card Advisor is an intelligent web-based application designed to help users find the most suitable credit card recommendations based on their financial profile and spending habits. Users can interact with the advisor through a natural language chat interface, providing details about their income, spending categories (like online shopping, groceries, fuel), and preferred reward types (e.g., cashback, reward points). The system then processes this information, queries a database of credit cards, filters them based on eligibility and preferences, calculates estimated rewards, and presents a personalized list of top recommendations.

## Features

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Parses user queries to extract key financial data (income, spending) and preferences (reward type, categories).
* **Database Integration:** Connects to a MySQL database to fetch detailed information about various credit cards.
* **Smart Filtering:** Filters credit cards based on user's income eligibility, preferred reward types, and spending categories.
* **Personalized Reward Calculation:** Estimates potential cashback or rewards a user can earn with each recommended card based on their spending patterns and card-specific reward structures.
* **Interactive Chat Interface:** Provides a user-friendly conversational experience for getting recommendations.
* **Aesthetic Frontend:** A clean and modern user interface for an improved user experience.
